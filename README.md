THE FUTURE OF SPACE INDUSTRIES 

JAI SHREE RAM !

A group of robots, designing for the purpose of explore the surfaces of other planets and moons.

How do these look like ?
Basically, these are a group of hexaped robots that look like a group of spiders. These are interconnected with each other by RF channels. 

How will they be working ?
After the landing of lander on the surface, they will be put on the surface. Now very firstly they will establish a communication among them to share the data on the real time.
After this, they will go away from the lander and collect samples from the surface and deposite them to lander.
Now the main and interesting process begins,
     They will be return to crawling in different directions and find a isolated place like any cave or crater. After finding a appropiate location to collect sample, they will be come together to work as a team.
     One or two from them, will be going to that targeted area and other will be supporting by enhancing networks and physical strength.
     
     ENHANCING NETWORKS;
            NEED - the most comman problem faced during these kind of action is poor networking (due to close envirment) and that causes in break down of connections between crawler and lander.
            SOLUTION - Now what SPARKS gonna do is, they are interconnected with each other as well as with lander. they will be working as a networking towers untill the last SPARK. 
    Physical Strength;
      Let, we wanna collect samples from the depth of the crater and it's difficult to climb up that again. Now we can connect them with each other from the same manner as they were connected to the lander. 
      The last SPARK will be connected by it's samples storage box. In case, if the other sparks couldn't pull it out then the SMAPLE STORAGE will be deattach from the SPARK and they will left the SPARK there and will pull out the SS only. 
    Now, they will come to the lander again and deposite the all SS and if possible, they will re-attach to the lander for the come back journy to the home !

Thanking You
